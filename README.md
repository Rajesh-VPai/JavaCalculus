## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Rajesh-VPai/JavaCalculus/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for


**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

#### About Java Calculus
JavaCalculus is a Maths String Java Package that has the below:
1. Expression Interface:To obtain the value of a String Equation.
    - Taken initially from StackOverflow. Code written by StackOverflow User:Boann  and 
    - Code written by StackOverflow User:Mike Scholtes
    - Free Source
2. Differentiation Interface:To obtain the Symbolic Differentiation of an String Equation.
3. Integration Interface:To obtain the Symbolic Integration of an String Equation.
4. Algebra Interface :To obtain the expansion of an Algebraic multiplication of 2 equations.
5. Function Composition Interface :To obtain the Function Composition of 2 equations.

JavaCalculus is about 12,000 Lines of Lambda Calculus Code which does not use Numeric Analysis Methods (Newton Raphso etc).
This is just High School Mathematics Maths Formulae with Java Lambda Calculus Code.
This has been been tested for:
1. Constant Coefficients (Integer , Double )
2. X Term (Can be any primary Variable: z, a1, ao, an, a123 etc)

Work In Progress (Future Development):
1. Independent Constants: dy/dx(ax+b) where a & b are independent constants with respect to x.
2. Functions
3. Parenthesis

Development and Test Environment: Windows XP and Java 7 & Neteans 8.2

Testing has been rigorous with the TestHarness Testing 216 Types(Formats) of Equations 
This can be checked out by the User by running the Function (method):mainRegresssionDiffTest  and mainRegressionIntegrTest

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Rajesh-VPai/JavaCalculus/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
